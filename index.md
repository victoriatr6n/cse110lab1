# Hi! I'm Victoria Tran
- I am a second year Computer Science student at UC San Diego
- I am an aspiring Software Engineer, and I am passionate about using my knowledge and experience in technology to create something that will have a significant impact on those around me. I enjoy interdisciplinary studies and being able to synthesize my knowledge from various subjects.
- Outside of school, in my free time, I enjoy playing tennis, drawing/painting, listening to music, and baking.
##One of the quotes I like to follow is 
> Working out will make you feel weak when it is actually making you stronger. Learning will make you feel dumb when it is actually making you smarter. Investing in yourself will make you feel broke when it is actually making you richer. Facing your fears will make you feel afraid when it is actually making you braver. So, never hold yourself back. Strive to be better tomorrow than you were today.
### Incorporating this into my life
When I feel a mental block when I am coding or even starting any project, I like to remind myself that having something is better than nothing, and once I start having something in my project (or whatever I am applying this mindset to), I can always go back and edit it later. You cannot edit nothing, but you can edit something. Thus, when I am coding and I find msyelf staring at blank files, my favorite line to print is

```
print("Hello World!) 
```
